# EchoFilter

EchoFilter is a browser extension and web-based email filter built to protect users from scams, phishing, and other harmful emails by completely hiding suspicious messages and giving users the option to safely review them. Rather than simply making emails appear as spam, EchoFilter replaces harmful and dangerous messages with a white and blank placeholder, preventing users from seeing or interacting with the content by accident. EchoFilter is different in a way that it gives the user the power to choose. If a user clicks See Anyways, the extension reveals the full email along with a clear explanation of why it was flagged, whether it’s because of a suspicious link, a real and fake sender address comparison, or manipulative language. This approach offers protection without removing user control, and also helps users learn to recognize phishing and scam techniques themselves.

## User Experience Behavior:
When a user opens an email, EchoFilter immediately scans it for scam indicators using simple rule-based checks (e.g., does the link text match the actual URL? Is the domain recently registered? Does the body contain scam phrases?). If anything suspicious is found, the inline warning banner is shown automatically.
When the user interacts with links, tooltips provide real-time insight into where the link really leads. If the user wants more information, clicking “View Details” expands the warning into a full breakdown of red flags.
The extension icon popup acts as a central command center for recent alerts, keeping the user informed of threats without cluttering the inbox.
